A sample machine learning model for classifying tweets related to coronavirus.

This section contains a simple implementation of coronavirus tweet classification model on top of JavaScript using the following technologies:

 - NodeJS
 - Natural JS
 - csvtojson

 ## Purpose
 The classification model showcased in this section is used for determining the Sentiment of a tweet relating to coronavirus


## Dataset Credits
Big thanks from [aman from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datatattle) for the dataset.


## Sample Results
The classifier produced the following results:
 ```sh
Accurate: 1397 items
Missed: 2401 items
Accuracy: 36.78
Error Rate: 63.22
 ```

A not so good results over there. But no worries! This opens the opportunity for us to learn on how we can improve the accuracy of our machine learning model.
